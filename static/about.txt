
Present via Pixel (face recognition attendance system)


Overview:-

Present via Pixel is a face recognition–based attendance system developed for NTTF College.
It replaces traditional roll calls with a smart, camera‑based solution that records every presence digitally
and in real time.


Purpose:-

The main purpose of this project is to automate classroom attendance, reduce paperwork, and prevent proxy attendance.
By using facial recognition, the system ensures that only the actual student standing in front of the camera is
marked present.


Key Features:-

Face recognition–based attendance marking

Automatic date, time and status (On‑Time / Late)

Separate dashboards for students, teachers and admins

Attendance history and daily summary view

Export of attendance data to CSV and Excel formats


How It Works:-

Students and teachers first log in securely to the web portal using their credentials.
When a student stands in front of the camera, the system compares the live face with stored encodings and,
on a successful match, marks attendance with timestamp and status.


Technology Stack:-

This project is built using Python, Flask and SQLite on the backend.
OpenCV and the face_recognition library are used for image processing, while HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and
JavaScript handle the user interface.


Benefits for NTTF:-

Present via Pixel helps NTTF move towards a paperless and digital attendance process.
It saves classroom time, improves accuracy of attendance records, and gives faculty quick access to
reports for academic and administrative purposes.
