1. Face‑powered attendance:-
The system uses facial recognition so a student is marked present just by standing in front of the
camera—no ID cards or manual roll call.

2. Automatic date, time and status:-
Every attendance entry automatically stores the exact date and time and marks the student as
 “On Time” or “Late” based on the class start time.

3. Smart campus radius control:-
Attendance can only be marked when the user is inside the allowed campus area radius,
so students cannot mark attendance from home or outside college.

4. Single login, multiple roles:-
One clean login page works for students, teachers and admins, and after login each user
sees only the options and dashboard meant for their role.

5. Live camera preview:-
A live camera window shows the student’s face in real time, helping them stand at the correct
distance and angle before the system confirms attendance.

6. One record per student per day:-
Even if the same student comes in front of the camera many times, only one attendance entry is stored
for that date, keeping the database clean and accurate.

7. Easy student enrollment:-
New students can be registered quickly with name, token number and face capture; their face encoding
is saved once and reused for all future classes.

8. Secure password and reset flow:-
User passwords are stored in encrypted form, and a “Forgot Password” feature lets students reset their
password safely without exposing their old one.

9. Powerful attendance reports:-
Teachers and admins can instantly download attendance in CSV or Excel format, making it easy to
see present/absent lists and use the data in reports.

10. Modern and user‑friendly interface:-
A clean home page, clear headings and a single main Login button give the system a professional
look and make it simple for first‑time users to understand.
